                <article>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CatDog (voiced by Jim Cummings and Tom Kenny) are a conjoined cat and dog sibling. 
                    Cat is the smarter and more cunning and Dog is the more happy-go-lucky and more naive. 
                    Cat often devises plans to trick Dog into getting what he wants, such as making Dog smarter 
                    in an attempt to have more in common with him, or having him win a dog sledding contest by 
                    training him in a very hard and militaristic manner, and usually, as a result of his greediness 
                    and selfishness, these schemes all blow up in his face. Dog is the source of clumsiness. As his 
                    name implies, he is a dog.</article>

                <article>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winslow Thelonious Oddfellow (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) is a tailless blue mouse that lives in 
                    CatDog's house in the hole in the wall. Winslow speaks with a typical Brooklyn accent. Winslow is 
                    always full of wisecracks about anything and everything. He is very sneaky and underhanded with CatDog, 
                    especially with Cat. Winslow and Cat do not get along very well at all, because he is always getting 
                    Cat in trouble. However, it was eventually revealed that Winslow may be afraid of Cat, because Cat 
                    tried to eat him once. Dog, however, does not mind Winslow and is friendly with him.</article>

                <h2 id="tr3">The Greaser Dogs</h2>
                <article>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greaser Dogs are a street gang of three tough dogs named Cliff, Shriek and Lube, who act no differently 
                    from school playground bullies, picking on anyone either weaker or different from them, usually with a 
                    "pounding". They pick on CatDog (mostly Cat) because of their freakish nature. Dog sometimes gets along 
                    with them because he is also a canine. They initiated him into the gang after he had proven his worth. 
                    The Greaser Dogs also have a fear of ticks, which renders them helpless in almost any situation. The name 
                    Greasers is a reference to the greaser subculture.</article>
